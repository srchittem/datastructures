1. Created 2 threads using std::thread library
2. When I want to pass arguments as a reference, found that it is not straight forward and we must use std::ref for passing by reference to the thread function.
3. std::ref useful another case with bind (https://thispointer.com/stdbind-tutorial-and-usage-details/)

TO continue tomorrow:
1. Move semantics in general
2. How to pass ownership to a thread
